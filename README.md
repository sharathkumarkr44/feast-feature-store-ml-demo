Feast Feature Store with ML Model Training & Real-Time Inference

This notebook demonstrates how to use Feast, an open-source feature store, in a practical machine learning workflow.
It showcases:

Feature definition, registration, and retrieval using Feast

Point-in-time correct feature generation for model training

Real-time feature serving using Feast’s online store

Training a classification model using driver stats data

Performing real-time predictions with latest feature values

The project uses Feast’s built-in driver_stats.parquet dataset and walks through an end-to-end MLOps use case:

✅ Reproducible feature pipelines
✅ Seamless integration between training and serving
✅ Scalable real-time inference with consistent features

This serves as a complete, beginner-friendly example for:

Data Scientists exploring MLOps best practices

MLOps Engineers evaluating feature store tooling

Developers building production-ready ML systems

🌐 Run it in Google Colab
🧪 Tested with Feast v0.32+
⚙️ No cloud dependencies required – runs fully locally in Colab

To run this notebook:

Clone the repo or open the .ipynb in Colab

Follow the instructions step by step

Optional: extend with your own features or connect to BigQuery, Redis, etc.
