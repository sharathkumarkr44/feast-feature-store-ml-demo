Feast Feature Store with ML Model Training & Real-Time Inference

This notebook demonstrates how to use Feast, an open-source feature store, in a practical machine learning workflow.
It showcases:

Feature definition, registration, and retrieval using Feast

Point-in-time correct feature generation for model training

Real-time feature serving using Feast’s online store

Training a classification model using driver stats data

Performing real-time predictions with latest feature values

The project uses Feast’s built-in driver_stats.parquet dataset and walks through an end-to-end MLOps use case:


Optional: extend with your own features or connect to BigQuery, Redis, etc.
